# Wigcpp: A Wigner-3j 6j and 9j Symbol Calculator Wrintten in C++ 17

## Citation

This project uses prime factorization and multi word integer arithmetic to calculate wigner-3j, 6j and 9j symbols,
	which is derived from the article:

> H. T. Johansson and C. Forssén, 
> "Fast and Accurate Evaluation of Wigner 3j, 6j, and 9j Symbols Using Prime Factorization and Multiword Integer Arithmetic" ,
> SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 38(1) (2016), A376-A384.

Algorithm in this project was inspired by the [WIGXJPF](https://fy.chalmers.se/subatom/wigxjpf/) library, 
developed by the main developer Håkan T. Johansson, for high-precision computation of Wigner symbols.
