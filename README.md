# WIGCPP: A Wigner-3j 6j and 9j Symbol Calculator Wrintten in C++ 17

## Acknowledgments

Algorithm in this project was inspired by the [WIGXJPF](https://fy.chalmers.se/subatom/wigxjpf/) library, 
developed by the main developer HÃ¥kan T. Johansson, for high-precision computation of Wigener symbols.
